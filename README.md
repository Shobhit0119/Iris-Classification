# Iris Species Classification Project (Afame Technology Internship)

This repository showcases my data science internship project at Afame Technology, where I focused on classifying Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning. The project follows a comprehensive data science workflow, demonstrating my proficiency in data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the Iris dataset into the Python environment.
   - Explore the dataset's features and their characteristics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Check for and handle missing values or duplicates in the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features and species.
   - Gain insights to inform model selection and feature engineering.

4. **Data Transformation (Feature Engineering):**
   - Transform categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Select and train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Compare model results to identify the most effective model.

## Key Highlights

- Thorough data exploration and visualization with insightful plots and charts.
- Robust data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Application of various machine learning models to tackle the classification problem.
- Rigorous evaluation and comparison of model performance to identify the best approach.
